    Assigning this class to a nif:String has definitory character. 
    A string that can be considered a word or a punctuation mark, the sentence 'He enters the room.' for example has 5 words. In general, the division into nif:Word is done by a tokenizer. Instances of this class are defined as a string, that is a 'meaningful' unit of characters. The class is not descriptive, but prescriptive. All NIF tools are supposed to either honor the current assignment of nif:Word or possibly correct it, if that is intended by the developer. 
    The class has not been named 'Token' as the NLP definition of 'Token' is more similar to our definition of nif:String in general, e.g. "can't" could be one, two or three tokens.
